# System-Application-for-finding-best-classifier-and-results-of-different-classifiers

This application was made in a group of two (me and https://github.com/Kaushiki333 ) as a part of our minor project in our third year of undergratuation. 

It is capable of finding the result metrics of six very commmonly used classification techniques; and can also find the best classifier for any dataset.

The algorithms include:
1) Information Gain
2) Gini Index
3) Naive Bayes
4) KNN
5) Random Forest
6) Gradient Boost

How to use the Application? See the instruction in the ppt presentation named "MinorProject- ppt-18103053_18103054" attached along with this (Page no. 18).

This project would be of concern for Data Analysts, Researchers, Students, Developers, Testers and Project Managers

Thank you !!
